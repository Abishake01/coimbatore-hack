## Key features and Functionalities

1. **3D Avatar Interaction:**

A 3D avatar is integrated using @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei.
The avatar supports facial expressions, lip-syncing, and animations.
Facial expressions (e.g., smile, sad, angry) are dynamically applied based on the message context.

2. **Chat Functionality:**

A chat system is implemented using a custom useChat hook.
Messages are sent to a backend API (https://virtual-gf-py.vercel.app/chat) and responses are displayed.
Messages are processed in a queue, and the avatar speaks the responses using Speech Synthesis.

3. **Speech Synthesis:**

The avatar speaks messages using the Web Speech API.
Lip-syncing is implemented by randomly selecting visemes (mouth shapes) during speech.

4. **Voice Input:**

Users can input messages via voice using the Web Speech Recognition API.
The microphone button activates voice input, and the recognized text is sent as a message.

5. **Camera Controls:**

The camera can zoom in and out using a toggle button.
Camera positions are controlled using CameraControls from @react-three/drei.

6. **Green Screen Mode:**

A green screen mode can be toggled on/off, changing the background to green for chroma keying.

7. **Loading Indicators:**

A loading animation (dots) is displayed while waiting for a response from the backend.
